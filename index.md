We study the physics of various processes at the air-sea interface, such as boundary layer turbulence, ocean surface waves, and the resulting ocean mixing, aiming not only at a better understanding of such processes themselves, but also insights into the effects of such small-scale processes on the large-scale weather and climate. To do that, we conduct large eddy simulations of ocean boundary layer turbluence under complex conditions including the influence of ocean surface waves; we develop physically-based parameterizations to represent the effects of small-scale processes on large-scale processes in climate models; and we assess their impact on the regional and global climate using idealized and realistic climate simulations and projections. We also explore novel approaches to improve the efficiency of numerical models for studying the interactions between physical processes across scales, such as GPU-accelerated computing and multiscale modeling.
