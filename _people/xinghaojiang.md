Xinghao joined the group as a PhD student in Sep 2023. He is currently working on the interaction between ocean surface boundary layer turbulence and submesoscale flows. Before joining the group, Xinghao obtained a Master's degree in Fluid Machinery and Engineering from the [School of Energy and Power Engineering](http://epe.xjtu.edu.cn) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn), working with [Prof. Jiazhong Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jzzhang/1) on studying the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers in supersonic flow. Xinghao also holds a Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from the same institution.
