Langmuir turbulence results from the interaction between the ocean surface waves and the Eulerian currents and background turbulence. See [this video](https://youtu.be/OAOESUrh2FI){:target="_blank"} for an example of Langmuir turbulence seen at the sea surface. It strongly affects the turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL), and therefore the air-sea fluxes of heat, momentum and trace gases, as well as the transport and dispersion of pollutants, nutrients and other tracers. I study the physics of Langmuir turbulence using large eddy simulations (LES) of the wave phase averaged Boussinesq equations. [Here](https://youtu.be/0QcNs5Y8GmM){:target="_blank"} is a movie of the simulated Langmuir turbulence in LES. My research on Langmuir turbulence has been focusing on its distinctive structure from shear and convective turbulence and its effect on the entrainment at the base of the OSBL. This figure is a comparison of the anisotropy between shear turbulence (top panels) and Langmuir turbulence (bottom panels). See more in papers [[6]](publications.html#li2017jpo) and [[11]](publications.html#li2020prfluid). I'm also interested in its interactions with other processes such as submesoscale fronts and eddies.
