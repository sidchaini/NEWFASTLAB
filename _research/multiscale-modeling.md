Ocean circulations are governed by processes ranging from planetary-scale forcing to microscale dissipation and mixing. Simulations that resolve all the important processes across multiple scales are desirable but extremely computationally expensive. The multiscale modeling approach intends to solve distinct sets of equations for the dynamics at different scales. At [LANL](https://www.lanl.gov){:target="_blank"}, I've been developing a multiscale modeling approach by coupling a large eddy simulation model ([PALM](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac){:target="_blank"}) with an ocean general circulation model ([MPAS-Ocean](https://mpas-dev.github.io/ocean/ocean.html){:target="_blank"}). The goal is to extend the multiscale modeling capability of MPAS-Ocean to include the boundary layer turbulence, thus to better understand the interactions between the boundary layer turbulent mixing and larger scale processes with a loose but flexible coupling strategy. See more in paper [[12]](publications.html#li2020gmd).
