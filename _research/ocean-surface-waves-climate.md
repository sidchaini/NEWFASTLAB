Ocean surface waves affect the air-sea fluxes of heat, momentum and gases, thereby the regional and global climate, but are missing in most of the [CMIP5](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/){:target="_blank"} climate models. A major part of my PhD work focused on assessing the impact of ocean surface waves on global climate, in particular the effect of Langmuir turbulence. I coupled a global climate model ([NCAR's CESM](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu){:target="_blank"}) with an ocean surface wave model ([NOAA's WAVEWATCH&nbsp;III](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/){:target="_blank"}) for this purpose. I also developed a computationally efficient <i>statistical wave model</i> for Langmuir turbulence parameterizations to avoid the significant computational cost of WAVEWATCH&nbsp;III. See more in papers [[4]](publications.html#li2016ocemod) and [[5]](publications.html#li2017ocemod). In addition to Langmuir turbulence, ocean surface waves also affect the regional and global climate through wave breaking, wave-current interactions and wave-sea ice interactions etc. A coupled ocean surface wave component in climate models also allows us to account for such effects.
